A guide to the project management body of knowledge PMBOK Guide 

**Project Life Cycle**:

- The PMBOK Guide describes the project life cycle as a series of phases, including initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing. Understanding the life cycle helps in structuring and managing the project effectively.

**Knowledge Areas**:

- The PMBOK Guide introduces ten knowledge areas that encompass various aspects of project management,

>including scope, time, cost, quality, communication, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management.

Scope: Define scope, setting upper bounds for the project to ensure that you do not run out of time. 

Time: This aspect can be managed by setting milestones and deliverables and following a schedule  

Cost: Negligible in our case, but a valid consideration in regards to time 

Communication: This aspect is built from the ground up in a group environment, ensuring correct communication channels are opened and used. It is also important to note that it's important to strive for effective communication, making use of available time.

Risk: Low in regards to our project since it is not a real life example, however possible risks include: Failing to complete all brief objectives, misunderstanding some aspect of the brief, disagreements within the team, over-scoping the project. >How can these risks be managed?

# **Project Constraints**:

- The book emphasizes that every project is bound by constraints, known as the "triple constraint" or "iron triangle," which includes scope, schedule, and cost. Managing these constraints is essential for project success.
## Iron Triangle
>Triple constraint/Iron Triangle would be a good term to use in the presentation to introduce the audience to the key aspects of project planning. 


## **[[Work Breakdown Structure]] (WBS)**:


- It promotes the use of the Work Breakdown Structure, a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team. This helps in organizing and managing project tasks.

- The process of creating a WBS involves decomposition, which means breaking the project into smaller, manageable pieces. Each level of the hierarchy represents a more detailed level of work. This helps in ensuring that no critical tasks are overlooked and provides a clear framework for project execution

>Mention WBS in the presentation to show how large scale tasks were broken down into their smallest components then implemented one at a time, which helps in maintaining scope, a part of the iron triangle. It also gives a good method of progress tracking, which helps with time management.

May be worth addressing project stakeholder management, even though it has little sway on our project, might make nathan happy.


# **Risk Management**:

- Risk management is a critical aspect of project management. The PMBOK Guide outlines processes for identifying, analyzing, and responding to project risks.

# **Communication Management**:

- Effective communication is essential in project management. The guide covers various communication processes and tools to facilitate communication within the project team and with stakeholders.
# **Quality Management**:

- It emphasizes the importance of quality in project management and provides guidance on planning, assurance, and control of project quality.

# **Ethical Considerations**:

- It discusses ethical considerations in project management and emphasizes the need for ethical behavior, transparency, and accountability.

# Introduction: 

>In this presentation we will talk about the Timetable Generation System
>
 We will cover how we came together, chose our project, and collaborated to create a project plan,(maybe paragraph 2) using various project and team management techniques to develop an effective solution, following the criteria of the brief.

## Project Aims and Identifying the challenge
The aim of the project is to develop a timetable generation system that ensures there is no overlap between timeslots in classrooms, and that every module delivers its required contact hours every week. 

This requires the design of an algorithm that is capable of handling these issues while simultaneously providing smooth operation and intuitive user experience.

## How we want to address the problem:

We intend to use a multi-disciplinary software development approach that consists of:

- Website Development to provide the user with an easy to use interface to interact with the system. 
- Database Configuration which will allow us to store information about the classrooms, modules, their required contact hours, and their respective lecturers. 
- A suitable software architecture to implement the required algorithm and connect the aforementioned parts of the program. 


## Realistic Expectations

While we aim to create the best product possible, there are some limitations once the scarcity of resources and time are considered. 

One of the ways we accounted for this was to host the website and application locally rather than on a server, using GitHub Pages as our platform to distribute the product.
(Maybe more?)


# Justification

- Involves software and web development therefore it relates to the interests and background experiences of the group.
- It will develop key technical skills which will be beneficial for the future.
- Lots of learning opportunities and complexity which we found appealing.


Script:
Out of the twenty projects that were available to choose from, the timetabling generation system was one of the most appealing to us. The project completely focuses on software development, which is a shared interest across all team members. Furthermore, there are team members which already have background experience and knowledge in programming which influenced our choice of projects, and will be an asset during the development of the timetabling system. 

By undertaking this task, we can develop key software and project management skills which will be beneficial for our future careers. We saw this as a learning opportunity where we can apply what we already know to a real life scenario and

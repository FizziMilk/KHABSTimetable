# Introduction: 

>In this presentation we will talk about the Timetable Generation System
>
 We will cover how we came together, chose our project, and collaborated to create a project plan,(maybe paragraph 2) using various project and team management techniques to develop an effective solution, following the criteria of the brief.

## Project Aims and Identifying the challenge
The aim of the project is to develop a timetable generation system that ensures there is no overlap between timeslots in classrooms, and that every module delivers its required contact hours every week. 

This requires the design of an algorithm that is capable of handling these issues while simultaneously providing smooth operation and intuitive user experience.

## How we want to address the problem:

We intend to use a multi-disciplinary software development approach that consists of:

- Website Development to provide the user with an easy to use interface to interact with the system. 
- Database Configuration which will allow us to store information about the classrooms, modules, their required contact hours, and their respective lecturers. 
- A suitable software architecture to implement the required algorithm and connect the aforementioned parts of the program. 


## Realistic Expectations

While we aim to create the best product possible, there are some limitations once the scarcity of resources and time are considered. 

One of the ways we accounted for this was to host the website and application locally rather than on a server, using GitHub Pages as our platform to distribute the product.
(Maybe more?)


# Justification

- Involves software and web development therefore it relates to the interests and background experiences of the group.
- It will develop key technical skills which will be beneficial for the future.
- Lots of learning opportunities and complexity which we found appealing.


Script:
Out of the twenty projects that were available to choose from, the timetabling generation system was one of the most appealing to us. The project completely focuses on software development, which is a shared interest across all team members. Furthermore, there are team members which already have background experience and knowledge in programming which influenced our choice of projects, and will be an asset during the development of the timetabling system.

# Project Management

- Once the team and team member roles were established, we were able to move on to creating a project plan. 

- As part of this, we undertook research into project management, relying on sources such as Engineers 2020 and the Project Management Body of Knowledge(PMBOK)

The PMBOK Guide describes the project life cycle as a series of phases, including initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, controlling, and closing. Understanding the life cycle helps in structuring and managing the project effectively.

The book emphasizes that every project is bound by constraints, known as the "triple constraint" or "iron triangle," which includes scope, schedule, and cost. Managing these constraints is essential for project success.

## WBS

In the context of this project, cost is mostly non-applicable, therefore, we've focused on the other two parts excessively. By creating a work breakdown structure we were able to solidify the scope of the project, ensuring that the deliverables and tasks are known from an early stage. 

The work breakdown structure is created by examining the required parts of a product, breaking those parts down into the work packages required to create them, and establishing the order in which those work packages need to be delivered. 

## Gantt Chart 

Once the WBS was finalized, it allowed us to create a Gantt Chart to address the scheduling part of the project. 
While creating the Gantt Chart, it is useful to consider what we know about risk management, dividing available time to ensure that the product is delivered on time, while allocating the appropriate amount of time to each task to ensure that any dependables are ready when they are needed.

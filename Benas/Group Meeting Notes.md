# INTRODUCTION: 

In this presentation we will talk about the Timetable Generation System

 We will cover how we came together, chose our project, and collaborated to create a project plan,(maybe paragraph 2) using various project and team management techniques to develop an effective solution, following the criteria of the brief provided to us by our supervisor.

## Project Aims and Identifying the challenge
>Fully function Timetable

The aim of the project is to develop a timetable generation system that ensures there is no overlap between timeslots in classrooms, and that every module delivers its required contact hours every week. 

This requires the design of an algorithm that is capable of handling these issues while simultaneously providing smooth operation and intuitive user experience.

## How we want to address the problem:
>Software Approach

We intend to use a multi-disciplinary software development approach that consists of:

- Website Development to provide the client with an interface to interact with the system. 
- Database Configuration which will allow us to store information about the classrooms, modules and their required contact hours and lecturers. 
- and finally A suitable software architecture to implement the required algorithm and connect the aforementioned parts/points of the program. 

We will go over why we chose these approaches and how they will be implemented.

# JUSTIFICATION:
## Realistic Expectations & Limitations (Option Analysis/Technical Solution Options)

While we aim to create the best product possible, there are some limitations once the scarcity of resources and time are considered. 

An example of such a limitation is how the timetabling system will be hosted and provided to clients. In an ideal scenario, we would want to push the system to a professional server and develop it on a larger scale, but we have limited scalability due to the lack of resources for our project. This means that the project will remain specialised for smaller workloads.

This approach gives insight on how we want to tackle the project, and defines the effort involved in what we are trying to achieve.

### Why we chose this (justification)


(justification page)
To justify the team's choice of project, we considered each team members skills and interests. We also considered the prospects and impact that the project would have for us and for the possible stakeholders and clients.

(earth) Needs lines?
Out of the twenty projects that were available to choose from, the timetable generation system was one of the most appealing to us. The project heavily focuses on software development, which is a shared interest across all team members. Furthermore, there are members which already have background experience and knowledge in programming which influenced our choice of projects, and will be an asset during the development of the system. 

(what it means) Title and lines unrelated?
By undertaking this task, we can develop key software engineering and project management skills which will be beneficial for our future careers. We saw this as a learning opportunity where we can apply what we already know, proving that as a team, we are capable of pursuing more complicated projects and challenges, applying new knowledge of engineering management principles, commercial context, project management and relevant legal matters [page 31 ahep]



# Idea Development

(intro) 
To develop the system, multiple stages of idea development are crucial to understand which tools, components and limitations are involved in developing the timetabling system. From this, ideas can be fleshed out and concepts can be implemented in real world situations by understanding the stakeholders needs.
The information obtained comes from idea development techniques derived from evidence-based reasoning, research and of course, the brief criteria provided by our supervisor, as well as every team members' invaluable personal experience with programming concepts and/or project management skills. https://digitalpromise.org/initiative/360-story-lab/360-production-guide/investigate/augmented-reality/idea-development/stages-of-idea-development/#:~:text=Through%20idea%20development%2C%20a%20developer,understanding%20people's%20needs%20and%20problems. [reference for idea development]


(cards)
Beginning with a well-defined feasibility study, multiple factors come into play. 

The first being:**Technical:**

-        Where an in depth Analysis of current resources was conducted (Sharma, 2023)

-        and technical skills of the team as well as viability were examined (Sharma, 2023), so that specific roles could be assigned to each member, making the team as effective as possible.


Then there are the **Economical & Environmental:** factors:

-       which Focus on development cost (Sharma, 2023).

-        and any additional expenses that come from maintenance and revision.

* seeing how this project is software-based, there should be very little to no cost for development except for time, considering that we are not using professional servers as indicated in the "realistic expectations" section.

The project must comply with the third factor, the **Law**

-        For example, the data protection act (Sharma, 2023) must be considered amongst other important laws.

The fourth includes **Operational:** factors

-        which Focus on how to maintain successful operation of a system and what procedures should be implemented (Sharma, 2023) for that purpose,

Finally, **Scheduling:** is considered

-        by Setting realistic deadlines and following them (Sharma, 2023) accordingly.

These five factors were obtained from Sharma,
https://www.tatvasoft.com/outsourcing/2022/08/define-feasibility-study-in-software-engineering.html which defines what feasibility is in software development and the different kinds of factors that are involved.



After considering the feasibilities of the project, an option analysis can be conducted to determine how the project should be constructed, where we consider if:

* the project should be website or console based,
* if the server should be hosted locally or externally,
* and if the timetable should be manually or automatically generated

After considering our expectations and supervisor advice, we decided that the project should be website-based, being locally hosted and manually generated. We did consider the possibility of automatically generating the timeslots and other features, but after discussing with our supervisor, this would only be done if there was enough time left over.

-- TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS --

- Adhering to the brief, the timetable generation system is based on Object Oriented Programming and uses techniques such as composite design.

* WE can choose either Python or Java as our main programming language for this purpose.

* Considering that  We need to use tools that will empower the use of these object-oriented concepts and adhere to the brief as much as possible, Java is chosen for this project because it is an object-oriented programming language, but also because it is secure, simple and platform independent https://data-flair.training/blogs/pros-and-cons-of-java/. Java also supports something called Springboot which is a framework for software engineering that streamlines the development process of applications, which will be incredibly useful for our project. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-java-spring-boot#:~:text=Spring%20Boot%20gives%20an%20easier,learn%20the%20underlying%20Spring%20framework. [reference for springboot]

* The previous programming experience that our team has is also related to Java, and therefore we have a better advantage using it instead of Python.

Due to our intentions of keeping the project on a smaller scale, we chose SQLite as our datebase, as it works great for most low to medium traffic websites and is very simple to setup, which is definitely within our category. https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html [reference for SQLite]

All this is done with the knowledge that as engineers, we must strive to  Select and apply appropriate materials, equipment, engineering technologies and processes (Ahep B13)


-- SUSTAINABILITY -- 

In our project, we are aiming to design solutions that will Evaluate the environmental and societal impact of solutions to our problems. [ahep B7 page 30]

We ensure that there is a balance of these solutions within our project by scheduling appropriately using a Gantt chart for example, keeping the scope as intended and creating software that requires little maintenance after deployment. 


> Team Dynamics (effective team, stakeholder communication plan, how roles were assigned, task assignment)

To ensure that the team is able to be as effective as possible, a leader was chosen so that members can complete their tasked deliverables within time schedules, and to guarantee responsibility for each member. https://www.sienaheights.edu/10-reasons-leadership-is-important-in-the-workplace/ [leadership reference]

--- read bens character description ---

 Roles and deliverables were given out based on strengths and weaknesses, and the whole decision-making process was done as a team, rather than one individual being responsible for planning everything. (look at the table on presentation)

The team has consistent meetings to ensure there is open communication between stakeholders, and that deadlines are being met effectively. A team communication leader was appointed to help with this purpose.

(go through each of the team members)

All of this was made possible by the open-minded individuals in our team who understand these responsibilities and tactics that allowed us to be as efficient and effective as possible as a team. All of this reinforces the notion that as engineers in a team environment we strive to function effectively as individuals, and as members or leaders of the team. (Ahep B16)

Because we applied these methods, we ensure a mutual benefit for both ourselves and the stakeholders of the project. 


# Project Management

- Once the team and team member roles were established, we were able to move on to the next stage of our project plan.

- In this stage we undertook research into project management, relying on sources such as Engineers 2020 and the Project Management Body of Knowledge(PMBOK) 

The PMBOK Guide describes the project life cycle as a series of phases, including initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, controlling, and closing. Understanding the life cycle helps in structuring and managing the project effectively. (Project Management Institute, 2008, p6)

The book emphasizes that every project is bound by constraints, which includes but are not limited to scope, schedule, and cost. Managing these constraints is essential for project success. (Project Management Institute, 2008, p6)




## WBS

In the context of this project, cost is mostly non-applicable, therefore, we've focused on the other two parts excessively, which are scope and schedule. By creating a work breakdown structure we were able to solidify the scope of the project, ensuring that the deliverables and tasks are known from an early stage. 

The work breakdown structure is created by examining the required parts of the product, breaking those parts down into the work packages required to create them, and establishing the order in which those work packages need to be delivered. 

> **Explain each part of the work breakdown structure briefly**

Here we can see the work breakdown structure that was created for this project. The blocks in white denote the major deliverables that are necessary for the completion of the Timetable System. The blocks in green beneath the first level show the breakdown of the work required for that deliverable to be completed. While it is possible to break those blocks down further into third level work-packages, it was deemed to be too technical for this presentation and thus omitted. 

An additional benefit of the Work Breakdown Structure is that it is a visual form of describing the work required to complete a product, without needing to delve into the technical details, which helps to >Communicate effectively with technical and non-technical audiences. (ahep B17)

## Gantt Chart 

Once the WBS was finalized, it allowed us to create a Gantt Chart to address the scheduling part of the project and solidify the order in which the tasks must be carried out. 
While creating the Gantt Chart, it is useful to consider what we know about risk management, dividing available time to ensure that the product deadlines are met, while scheduling each task appropriately to ensure that any dependables are ready when they are needed. Failure to consider and account for these risks may cause knock-on delays in completing future tasks on time, to the detriment of the stakeholders and the product.

## Risk Management

§  Why do we need to consider risk management?

There are uncertainties in every project. Our timetable system project's success is influenced by how well we handle these uncertainties. The Project management plan needs to use a risk management process which identifies, analyses, evaluates, treats, monitors, records, reports and reviews risks (https://www.engc.org.uk/media/3824/guidance-on-risk.pdf reference)

For us this process involved analysing deliverables and factors that could significantly affect our project if something were to go wrong. These risks could include:

- team members not being able to achieve deliverables due to personal reasons
- integrating software together incorrectly causing program crashes and errors
- a possibility of data or code being lost
- and a possible failure to assess the time required for team members to learn new software or tools

We can mitigate these risks by implementing safeguards: for example, the loss of data is prevented by using a version control software called Git. A generous amount of time for key deliverables and research is given to ensure members have sufficient space to develop their skills and work. This also assists with acquiring knowledge to avoid integrating issues.

## Quality Management

The PMBOK guide identifies the main processes of effective project quality management such as 
- Creating a plan which will identify the quality requirements of the project, and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance to the plan
- Performing quality assurance, which is the process of examining the plan to ensure appropriate standards being are maintained
- and Performing Quality Control, the process of monitoring and recording results of executing the quality activities to assess performance and recommend necessary changes.  (Project Management Institute, 2008, p189)


While there are many quality metrics that can be considered when it comes to software development, we have decided to focus on 4 main aspects that we believe are relevant for the creation of our quality plan.  

Reliability, Performance, User Experience, and code quality.
(Sealights,2019)

We distilled each of these criteria into quantifiable metrics which will be used throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the timetable system is up to standard to the quality plan.

Reliability: Average Failure Rate 
Performance: Time to Output, Stress Testing
User Experience: Average Time for effective usage of the system
Code Quality: Complexity and size analysis 

As noted in the PMBOK guide, these criteria are only introductory and will be implemented, monitored, audited, and changed to fit the growing quality standards and needs of the project. 

## Ethical Considerations

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

In this project, our team has committed to identifying ethical concerns and making reasoned ethical choices informed by professional codes of conduct (insert F8 ahep reference ETHICS) to ensure that all team members are contributing to the project and are treated equally and fairly. We ensure that all stakeholders have sufficient involvement and that no lack of communication is present.

This considers that every member of the team will not have an unrealistic workload and that the stakeholders requirements are met effectively.


## Next Steps...

Our next steps are to acquire sufficient knowledge on the software that will be used to develop the project. We will then begin engineering our project by following the Gantt chart schedule in our project management plan starting with algorithm design and undertaking research.

Thank you for listening to our presentation and we appreciate your future feedback.

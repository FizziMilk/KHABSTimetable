**5 types:**

**Technical:**

-        Analysis of current resources (Sharma, 2023).

-        Examining technical skills of the team as well as viability (Sharma, 2023).

-        Looks at the ease of maintenance and upgrading the technology used (Sharma, 2023).

**Economical:**

-        Focus on development cost (Sharma, 2023).

-        any additional costs like maintenance.

**Legal:**

-        project must be legal and to comply with the law e.g., data protection act (Sharma, 2023).

 **Operational:**

-        Focuses on how to maintain successful operation of a system and what procedures should be implemented (Sharma, 2023).

-        Some of the factors could be service teams, local websites and others (Sharma, 2023).

**Scheduling:**

-        Setting realistic deadlines and following them (Sharma, 2023).

**About the project:**

-        Java is more secure since it detects viruses and malware when it compiles. It doesn’t involve pointers like some other languages meaning that there will be no unauthorised access to memory. Because it’s an OOP language, it uses inheritance and abstraction which further strengthens the security and makes it a suitable option for a project like this one (Team, 2022).

-        In terms of costs, Java is very cost effective which makes it a very suitable option for this project. It can run on many platforms and it is also a simple build meaning that the cost of development will be low (Team, 2022). This also means the maintenance costs will be reduced which is very beneficial for a big institution that will use such system.

-        Some of the group members are experienced in Java and that will make the project easier to make and deliver it on time. If all group members were inexperienced, it would have been very difficult as everyone will have to learn from scratch, making it more time consuming and putting the project being delivered on time at risk.

-        Another reason Java is a great option for this project is that it’s one of the most stable languages. It goes through regular updates and that removes bugs which is vital for maintaining operation in such a large institution (Team, 2022). This will also reduce maintenance costs.

-        Automatic garbage collection is also present in Java. This means that any object that must be dereferenced will automatically be removed from the program by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and there will be no need to write extra coding (Team, 2022).

-        In terms of efficiency, Java is up there as one of the most efficient programming languages. It is a distributed language as it has a mechanism to share programs among multiple computers, increasing the performance of the system (Team, 2022). It also consumes low amounts of energy when executing programs on top of having a fast execution time (Pajorska, 2023). Because it’s energy efficient, it is beneficial for the environment and another reason why it is a good option for a project that a lot of people will be dependent on (Pajorska, 2023).

-        Since Java is secure, it complies with the data protection act therefore this project is legal and can be implemented with approval.

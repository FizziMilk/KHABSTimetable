# Introduction: 

>In this presentation we will talk about the Timetable Generation System
>
 We will cover how we came together, chose our project, and collaborated to create a project plan,(maybe paragraph 2) using various project and team management techniques to develop an effective solution, following the criteria of the brief.

## Project Aims and Identifying the challenge
The aim of the project is to develop a timetable generation system that ensures there is no overlap between timeslots in classrooms, and that every module delivers its required contact hours every week. 

This requires the design of an algorithm that is capable of handling these issues while simultaneously providing smooth operation and intuitive user experience.

## How we want to address the problem:

We intend to use a multi-disciplinary software development approach that consists of:

- Website Development to provide the user with an easy to use interface to interact with the system. 
- Database Configuration which will allow us to store information about the classrooms, modules, their required contact hours, and their respective lecturers. 
- A suitable software architecture to implement the required algorithm and connect the aforementioned parts of the program. 


## Realistic Expectations

While we aim to create the best product possible, there are some limitations once the scarcity of resources and time is considered. 

One of the ways we accounted for this was to host the website and application locally rather than on a server, using GitHub Pages as our platform to distribute the solution.
(Maybe more?)


# Justification

- Involves software and web development therefore it relates to the interests and background experiences of the group.
- It will develop key technical skills which will be beneficial for the future.
- Lots of learning opportunities and complexity which we found appealing.


Script:
Out of the 20 options that were available, this project was one of the most appealing to us. One of the reasons is that it involves software development which is related to our interests and is something that the team is passionate about. On top of that, some team members already have background experience and knowledge in programming which influenced our choice of projects, and will be an asset during the development of the product. 

By undertaking this task, it will help develop key software development skills such as project management which will be beneficial for our future careers. We saw this as a learning opportunity where we can apply what we already know to a real life scenario and 

# Idea development

Feasibility:

- Ensuring the project can be completed successfully

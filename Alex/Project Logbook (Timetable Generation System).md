First step was to install a software called IntelliJ IDEA which was beneficial for implementing the main program and sharing each part of the code with the other group members. This enabled the group to make changes and to fix any errors within the code, making sure the algorithm performs efficiently and without any problems.

After that, the group started coding the main body of the program. The team established what classes were needed and what objects to declare within those classes. The decisions of the classes were made according to the project brief, ensuring key requirements have been met.

Once the main body was programmed, I performed initial testing by running the code and identifying any logic errors. This was done by adding different inputs after compilation and testing to see if it functions correctly. After the errors were identified, I reported them to the Software implementer and the architect to make sure the problem is solved. 

some of the errors identified:
- "unable to find day" message is displayed with any day apart from Monday even though the days are found
- "Unable to find day" message is displayed after timeslot has been added, and the timeslot is not printed.

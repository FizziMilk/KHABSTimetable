First step was to install a software called IntelliJ IDEA which was beneficial for implementing the main program and sharing each part of the code with the other group members. This enabled the group to make changes and to fix any errors within the code, making sure the algorithm performs efficiently and without any problems.

After that, Everyone started coding the main body of the program. The team established what classes were needed and what objects to declare within those classes. The decisions of the classes were made according to the project brief, ensuring everyone adhered to it.

**Literature review and project planning**

Since software development is a key skill for many engineers in the modern age, the timetable system was one of the shortlisted projects out of the twenty provided. It is an opportunity to develop team-based software development skills that will be beneficial for the future in terms of teamworking and engineering capabilities for everyone involved.

Because it involves software and web development, it is related to the interests of the group members. In addition, all members have had previous experience in software development from our educational backgrounds. As such, we were drawn to this particular project for its complexity and learning opportunities.

The main application for this project is in educational institutions, where a timetable system is required that divides a limited amount of classrooms for the necessary amount of reference contact hours for each module.

In particular, the timetabling algorithm aims to ensure that time slot clashes will not occur between different modules, which is an problem in many existing universities and schools.

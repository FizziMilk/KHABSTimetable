# Introduction: 

>In this presentation we will talk about the Timetable Generation System
>
 We will cover how we came together, chose our project, and collaborated to create a project plan,(maybe paragraph 2) using various project and team management techniques to develop an effective solution, following the criteria of the brief.

## Project Aims and Identifying the challenge
The aim of the project is to develop a timetable generation system that ensures there is no overlap between timeslots in classrooms, and that every module delivers its required contact hours every week. 

This requires the design of an algorithm that is capable of handling these issues while simultaneously providing smooth operation and intuitive user experience.

## How we want to address the problem:

We intend to use a multi-disciplinary software development approach that consists of:

- Website Development to provide the client with a simplistic interface to interact with the system. 
- Database Configuration which will allow us to store information about the classrooms, modules and their required contact hours and lecturers. 
- A suitable software architecture to implement the required algorithm and connect the aforementioned parts/points of the program. 


## Realistic Expectations & Limitations

While we aim to create the best product possible, there are some limitations once the scarcity of resources and time are considered. 

An example of such a limitation is how the timetabling system will be hosted and provided to clients. In an ideal scenario, we would want to push the system to a server and develop it on a larger scale. However, this would involve larger costs and time, especially if the product was used constantly. For this reason, we are accounting for this by simply hosting the system locally using a platform like GitHub Pages (where websites can be seen by those with permission) which is free.

This approach gives insight on how we want to tackle the project, and defines the effort involved in what we are trying to achieve.

# Justification

- Involves software and web development therefore it relates to the interests and background experiences of the group.
- It will develop key technical skills which will be beneficial for the future.
- Lots of learning opportunities and complexity which we found appealing.

(justification page)
To justify the team's choice of project, we considered each team members skills and interests. We also considered the prospects and impact that the project would have for us and for the stakeholders/clients.

(earth)
Out of the twenty projects that were available to choose from, the timetabling generation system was one of the most appealing to us. The project heavily focuses on software development, which is a shared interest across all team members. Furthermore, there are team members which already have background experience and knowledge in programming which influenced our choice of projects, and will be an asset during the development of the timetabling system. 

(what it means)
By undertaking this task, we can develop key software and project management skills which will be beneficial for our future careers. We saw this as a learning opportunity where we can apply what we already know, proving that as a team, we are capable of pursuing more complicated projects and solutions.

# Idea Development

(intro)
To develop the product, multiple stages of idea development are crucial to understand which tools, components and limitations are involved in developing the timetabling system. The information obtained comes from idea development techniques derived from evidence-based reasoning, research and of course, the brief criteria, as well as every team members' invaluable personal experience with programming concepts and/or project management skills.


(cards)
For an understanding of the feasibility for the project, multiple factors come into play. Firstly, what programming languages will be utilised across the project?

- Adhering to the brief, the timetabling generation system is completely object-oriented based and uses complex techniques such as composite design.

* In the brief, two programming languages are given to choose from: Java or Python.
*  We need to use tools that will empower the use of these object-oriented concepts and adhere to the brief as much as possible, and Java is perfectly suited for this as it was built within OOP in mind. Java also supports very useful frameworks for website development such as Springboot, which enables a more streamlined development process.

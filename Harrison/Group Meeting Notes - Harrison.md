# Introduction: 

>In this presentation we will talk about the Timetable Generation System
>
 We will cover how we came together, chose our project, and collaborated to create a project plan,(maybe paragraph 2) using various project and team management techniques to develop an effective solution, following the criteria of the brief provided to us by our supervisor.

## Project Aims and Identifying the challenge
The aim of the project is to develop a timetable generation system that ensures there is no overlap between timeslots in classrooms, and that every module delivers its required contact hours every week. 

This requires the design of an algorithm that is capable of handling these issues while simultaneously providing smooth operation and intuitive user experience.

## How we want to address the problem:

We intend to use a multi-disciplinary software development approach that consists of:

- Website Development to provide the client with an interface to interact with the system. 
- Database Configuration which will allow us to store information about the classrooms, modules and their required contact hours and lecturers. 
- and finally A suitable software architecture to implement the required algorithm and connect the aforementioned parts/points of the program. 


## Realistic Expectations & Limitations

While we aim to create the best product possible, there are some limitations once the scarcity of resources and time are considered. 

An example of such a limitation is how the timetabling system will be hosted and provided to clients. In an ideal scenario, we would want to push the system to a professional server and develop it on a larger scale, but we have limited scalability due to the lack of resources for our project. This means that the project will remain specialised for smaller workloads.

This approach gives insight on how we want to tackle the project, and defines the effort involved in what we are trying to achieve.

An example of such a limitation is how the timetabling system will be hosted and provided to clients. In an ideal scenario, we would want to push the system to a professional server and develop it on a larger scale. However, this would involve larger costs and time, especially if the product was used constantly. For this reason, we are accounting for this by simply hosting the system locally using a platform like GitHub Pages (where websites can be seen by those with permission).


# Justification

- Involves software and web development therefore it relates to the interests and background experiences of the group.
- It will develop key technical skills which will be beneficial for the future.
- Lots of learning opportunities and complexity which we found appealing.


Script:


(justification page)
To justify the team's choice of project, we considered each team members skills and interests. We also considered the prospects and impact that the project would have for us and for the possible stakeholders and clients.

(earth)
Out of the twenty projects that were available to choose from, the timetabling generation system was one of the most appealing to us. The project heavily focuses on software development, which is a shared interest across all team members. Furthermore, there are members which already have background experience and knowledge in programming which influenced our choice of projects, and will be an asset during the development of the timetabling system. 

(what it means)
By undertaking this task, we can develop key software engineering and project management skills which will be beneficial for our future careers. We saw this as a learning opportunity where we can apply what we already know, proving that as a team, we are capable of pursuing more complicated projects and challenges, applying new knowledge of engineering management principles, commercial context, project management and relevant legal matters [page 31 ahep]



# Idea Development

(intro)
To develop the product, multiple stages of idea development are crucial to understand which tools, components and limitations are involved in developing the timetabling system. The information obtained comes from idea development techniques derived from evidence-based reasoning, research and of course, the brief criteria provided by our supervisor, as well as every team members' invaluable personal experience with programming concepts and/or project management skills.


(cards)
Beginning with a well-defined feasibility study, multiple factors come into play. 


The first being:**Technical:**

-        Where an in depth Analysis of current resources was conducted (Sharma, 2023)

-        and technical skills of the team as well as viability were examined (Sharma, 2023), so that specific roles could be assigned to each member, making the team as effective as possible.


Then there are the **Economical & Environmental:** factors:

-       which Focus on development cost (Sharma, 2023).

-        and any additional expenses that come from maintenance and revision.

* seeing how this project is software-based, there should be very little to no cost for development except for time, considering that we are not using professional servers as indicated in the "realistic expectations" section.


The project must comply with the third factor, the **Law**

-        For example, the data protection act (Sharma, 2023) must be considered amongst other important laws.

The fourth includes **Operational:** factors

-        which Focus on how to maintain successful operation of a system and what procedures should be implemented (Sharma, 2023) for that purpose,

Finally, **Scheduling:** is considered

-        by Setting realistic deadlines and following them (Sharma, 2023) accordingly.


After considering the feasibilities of the project, an option analysis can be conducted to determine how the project should be implemented, where we consider if:


* the project should be website or console based,
* if the server should be hosted locally or externally,
* and if the timetable should be manually or automatically generated

After considering our brief and resources, we decided that the project should be shown on a website that is locally hosted and that the timetable is manually generated.

-- TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS --

- Adhering to the brief, the timetabling generation system is based on OOP and uses techniques such as composite design.

* WE can choose either Python or Java as our main programming language for this purpose.

* Considering that  We need to use tools that will empower the use of these object-oriented concepts and adhere to the brief as much as possible, Java is perfectly suited for this as it was built within OOP in mind. Java also supports something called Springboot which is a framework for software engineering that streamlines the development process of applications, which will be incredibly useful for our project.

* The previous programming experience that our team has is also related to Java, and therefore we have a better advantage using it instead of Python.*

Due to our intentions of keeping the project on a smaller scale, we chose SQLite as our datebase, which doesn't require the use of a server host.


-- SUSTAINABILITY -- 

In our project, we are aiming to design solutions  that meet a combination of societal, user, business and customer needs as appropriate , This will involve consideration of applicable health and safety, diversity, inclusion, cultural, societal, environmental and commercial matters, codes of practice and industry standards. ( page 29 ahep )

We ensure that there is a balance of all of these within our project by scheduling appropriately, keeping the scope as intended and creating software that requires little maintenance after deployment. 

-- ben
This considers that every member of the team will not have an unrealistic workload and that the stakeholders requirements are met effectively.




> Team Dynamics (effective team, stakeholder communication plan, how roles were assigned, task assignment)

To establish our team, we already had four strong members at the beginning of this project. We then scouted for a fifth member, who we eventually recruited.

To ensure that the team is managed to be as effective as possible, a leader was chosen so that members can complete their tasked deliverables within time schedules, and to guarantee responsibility for each member. (show Benas on slide?)

 Roles and deliverables were given out based on strengths and weaknesses, and the whole decision-making process was done as a team, rather than one individual being responsible for planning everything. (look at the table on presentation)

The team has consistent meetings to ensure there is open communication between stakeholders, and that deadlines are being met effectively. A team communication leader was appointed to help with this purpose.

All of this was made possible by the open-minded individuals in our team who understand these responsibilities and tactics that allowed us to be as efficient and effective as possible as a team.

Because we applied these methods, we ensure a mutual benefit for both ourselves and the stakeholders of the project.

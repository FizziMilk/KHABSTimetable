§  Why do we need to consider risk management?

There is a degree of uncertainty in every software development project. Our timetable system project's success is determined by how well we handle these uncertainties. The Project management plan needs to use a risk management process which identifies, analyses, evaluates, treats, monitors, records, reports and reviews risks (https://www.engc.org.uk/media/3824/guidance-on-risk.pdf reference)

For us this process involved analysing deliverables and factors that could significantly affect our project if something were to go wrong. These risks could include:

- team members not being able to achieve deliverables due to personal reasons
- integrating software together incorrectly causing program crashes and errors
- a possibility of data or code being lost
- and a possible failure to assess the time required for team members to learn new software or tools

We can mitigate these risks by implementing safeguards: for example, the loss of data is prevented by using a version control software called Git. A generous amount of time for key deliverables and research is given to ensure members have sufficient space to develop their skills and work. This also assists with acquiring knowledge to avoid integrating issues.



ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

In this project, our team has committed to identifying ethical concerns and making reasoned ethical choices informed by professional codes of conduct (insert F8 ahep reference ETHICS)

all team members are contributing to the project and are treated equally and fairly. We ensure that all stakeholders have sufficient involvement and that no lack of communication is present.

This considers that every member of the team will not have an unrealistic workload and that the stakeholders requirements are met effectively.

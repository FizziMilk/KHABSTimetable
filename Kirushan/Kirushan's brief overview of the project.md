**Context on why we chose the project?**

Timetabling systems are used in a variety of industries, including enterprises, transportation, healthcare, and education, to simplify and optimise scheduling procedures. The primary reasons for implementing a timetabling system include:

Time and Cost Savings:- Scheduling automation shortens the amount of time required for manual planning, allowing organisations or enterprises to more effectively utilise their resources and save time. Both cost savings and increased productivity may come from this.

Efficiency and Optimisation:- Timetabling systems aid in the efficient arrangement of resources like classrooms, educators, cars, or equipment. Their objectives are to maximise resource utilisation, minimise disputes, and cut down on idle time.

Adaptability and Flexibility:- Complex limitations and preferences are handled by modern timetabling systems. Their ability to promptly adjust to alterations or unanticipated circumstances guarantees that timetables are flexible.

Enhanced Communication and Accessibility:- Timetabling systems frequently have interfaces that make it simple for stakeholders to view schedules. By offering a consolidated platform for updates and modifications, they help stakeholders communicate with one other.

**Applications of timetabling systems in the real world include:**

Educational Institutions: Timetabling systems are used by schools, colleges, and universities to efficiently handle student enrolments, assign professors to courses, and construct class schedules.

Event Management: To ensure that locations, presenters, and other resources are efficiently coordinated, timetabling systems are used in the planning and scheduling of events, conferences, and festivals.

Transportation and Logistics: Bus, train, airline, and other transit service timetables are managed in large part by timetabling. It facilitates crew scheduling management, vehicle assignment, and route optimisation.

All things considered, timetabling systems are essential to many different businesses because they provide an organised and effective method of scheduling and resource management, which improves both operational effectiveness and customer happiness.

Risk management & Ethical Considerations 

- Risk management 

§  What is risk management?

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks related to finances, law, strategy, and security that have an impact on an organisation's assets and earnings. These dangers, sometimes known as risks, can have a variety of causes, including unstable finances, unavoidable mishaps, legal obligations, poor strategic planning, and natural disasters.

§  Why do we need to consider risk management in our project?

High-level activities that make use of numerous technical innovations for projects such as the timetable systems. For all the reasons mentioned above and more, there is a degree of uncertainty in every software development project. Our timetable system project's success is determined by the level of risk involved in each project activity. Just being aware of the dangers is insufficient. Project management needs to identify, evaluate, rank, and handle all material dangers to be successful.

Whether they are improving efficiency or adding functionality, most of the software engineering and development projects want to be unique. It is not risk-free to take advantage of these possibilities, as any software project manager will tell you.

§  How will risk management benefit us as a group?

A project that is risk-free does not exist. To detect, evaluate, and ultimately lessen risks, there are a variety of techniques, risk response plans, and project risk management instruments that we can employ throughout project management. Let's talk about some possible hazards that could occur while developing software, along with remedies that the team and the project manager can put into practise.

An example of a risk would be if a colleague is no longer able to contribute to the assignment. It is very important for team members to be fully aware of the situation, especially team leaders.  It is so that someone will be able to substitute till another member is found or split the work further between each other. We must be considerate when splitting the work between each other as team members have strengths and weaknesses in tasks. We must also consider that every member of the team will not have an unrealistic workload and that the stakeholder’s requirements are met effectively.

How will we as a team be tackling the risks in our timetabling systems?

o   Identify the dangers and the contributing causes.

o   Every danger needs to be categorised and given a priority.

o   Make a plan that ties each danger to a countermeasure.

o   Throughout the project, be aware of potential sources of risk.

o   If a risk materialises, implement the necessary mitigating actions.

o   Keep the risks' status communicated throughout the project.

o   Risk management process

o   Identifying the risks

The process of determining and evaluating risks to a company's personnel, operations, and infrastructure is known as risk identification. Assessing IT security risks like malware and ransomware, as well as mishaps, natural disasters, and other potentially hazardous occurrences that could interfere with corporate operations, are a few examples of risk identification activities.

o   Analysing the risks and assessment

Determining the likelihood that a risk event will occur as well as the possible course of each occurrence are key components of risk analysis. Risk appraisal assesses risks based on prominence and consequence, comparing their respective magnitudes.

o   Risk mitigation and observation

The process of organising and creating strategies and solutions to lessen risks to project goals is known as risk mitigation. A project team may use risk mitigation techniques to pinpoint, track, and assess the risks and repercussions that come with finishing a particular project, like developing a new product. The steps taken to address problems and their repercussions on a project are also included in risk mitigation.
